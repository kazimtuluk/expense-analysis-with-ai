AI-Powered Expense Data Analytics

Manual expense tracking is time-consuming and unreliable. Each receipt takes over five minutes to record, receipts often fade or get lost, and categorizing expenses manually leads to inconsistencies. As a result, I wasted hours on data entry, missed potential tax deductions, and lacked clear insights into my spending habits.
My AI Solution
I built an automated data pipeline that transforms receipt images into structured analytics-ready data:
Receipt Image → OCR Extraction → AI Analysis → Structured Database → Dashboard Insights
Key Technologies:

Google Vision API: Extracts text from receipt images with 95%+ accuracy
Gemini AI: Interprets raw text and structures it into merchant, items, prices, categories
PostgreSQL: Stores normalized data with enhanced features (dual product naming, location intelligence)
Power BI: Visualizes spending patterns, trends, and insights
